                <li>Limitation of Liability: To the maximum extent permitted by law, the total aggregate liability of the Consultant to the Client under this Agreement shall not exceed the total Fees paid by the Client for the specific Services from which the claim arises.

            <ol>
                <li>Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing their obligations where such failure or delay results from any cause that is beyond the reasonable control of that party.
